## Hello! This is *Prakash Gawas*.


I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) and under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Louis-Martin Rousseau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/rousseau-louis-martin) and [Prof. Dr. Antoine Legrain](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/legrain-antoine-0). I also belong to the research groups of [CIRRELT](https://www.cirrelt.ca/), [GERAD](https://www.gerad.ca/) and [HANALOG](https://hanalog.ca/).


I completed my PhD at Polytechnique Montréal under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Louis-Martin Rousseau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/rousseau-louis-martin) and [Prof. Dr. Antoine Legrain](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/legrain-antoine-0). 

Before I received my Master's degree from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in the [IEOR](https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/) department.

My research focuses on applying machine learning to sequential decision-making in operations research, with applications in scheduling and logistics.

### Fun fact
I work on ML for sequential decision-making in OR, but still rely on heuristics for everyday life.
