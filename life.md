### Hobbies & Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy cooking and firmly believe I make a good butter chicken. Exploring the outdoors through hiking and trekking. You can also find occasional travel photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/prakash_gawas009/).
I also like running, which helps me reset between long research sessions.
